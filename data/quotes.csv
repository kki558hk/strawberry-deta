Warren Buffett,"Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you."

Chalie Munger,"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you."
Chalie Munger,"People calculate too much and think too little."
Chalie Munger,"Envy is a really stupid sin because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There's a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?"

Elon musk,"To make an embarrassing admission, I like video games. That's what got me into software engineering when I was a kid. I wanted to make money so I could buy a better computer to play better video games - nothing like saving the world."
Elon musk,"Any product that needs a manual to work is broken."
Elon musk,"Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product."

Elon musk,"If you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic - being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago."
Elon musk,"The value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear: I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad."
Elon musk,"If you're entering anything where there's an existing marketplace, against large, entrenched competitors, then your product or service needs to be much better than theirs. It can't be a little bit better, because then you put yourself in the shoes of the consumer... you're always going to buy the trusted brand unless there's a big difference."
Elon musk,"When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked."
Elon musk,"The problem is that at a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking. You're encouraged to behave like a little gear in a complex machine. Frankly, it allows you to keep people who aren't that smart, who aren't that creative."
Elon musk,"The key to making things affordable is design and technology improvements, as well as scale."
Elon musk,"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better."
Elon musk,"If you think back to the beginning of cell phones, laptops or really any new technology, it's always expensive."

Buy stock in several companies that make products & services that *you* believe in.

Jeff Bezos,"I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long-term, because a lot of invention doesn't work. If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and if you're going to experiment, you're going to fail, and if you're going to fail, you have to think long term."
Jeff Bezos,"Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital."
Jeff Bezos,"Percentage margins don't matter. What matters always is dollar margins: the actual dollar amount. Companies are valued not on their percentage margins, but on how many dollars they actually make, and a multiple of that."

Jeff Bezos,"It is very difficult to get people to focus on the most important things when you're in boom times."
Jeff Bezos,"There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."

Bill Gates,"It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure."

Bill Gates,"If you can't make it good, at least make it look good."

Bill Gates,"Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important."

Bill Gates,"I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be moved to act."
